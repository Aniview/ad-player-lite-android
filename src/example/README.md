# Running Example App

Running example application requires `publisher` and `tag` ids. They can be configured in the root `local.properties` file like this:

```properties
sdk.dir=...

av_pub_id={published id goes here}
av_tag_id={tag id goes here}
```

After this project can simply be opened in the Android Studio and built.
